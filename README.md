#Countdown Timer

Created this while following along with this CSS-Tricks tutorial: https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-animated-countdown-timer-with-html-css-and-javascript/#top-of-site

Found this while working on the Rock, Paper, Scissors project. I was looking for a method to do work in a set interval. Was happy, but not too surprised to find out the method is called by setInterval(). 

This project was fun to do. Some of it went over my head, but each time I revisit it I get (or git?) it a bit more. 

I added the prompt to set the countdown timer.

Cheers!
